### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
Although UI/UX design adds time up front in a project it almost always reduces the time and cost of a project overall by clarifying challenges up front and removing the need to redesign non-user centric features in the future.

Avoid coding in a silo and try to work collaboratively with designers when creating products.


### Guided Practice

Is this part of UI or UX Design?
The Font of the website? 
How a user gets from A to B?
Whether or not the button is round or square? 
What you name the menu items?
What happens after a user submits a form?
Why a piece of content was put at the top or bottom of a page?


### Independent Practice

Go to dribbble.com, pick 2 designs, list out 1-2 needs the design might be solving for it's intended users.


### Challenge

Pari up and interview your partner about what they love/a problem they have. Find a gift online that fits them based on your interview, aka their user needs and goals.


### Check for Understanding

Comparative exercise on which UI is better.
Pull up one webapp abnd ask how well does it currently serve the users' need? Would you change anything?
